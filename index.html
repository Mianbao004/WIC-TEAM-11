        <h1>Welcome to The Favors Economy!</h1>
        <p>Favors Economy is a social network for mutual friends to exchange favors, like giving a ride to the airport or borrowing an item. Users can post requests or offers, and friends in the network can respond, creating a community of shared help. It functions like a large group chat but with structured posts to track favors easily. The goal is to make asking for and giving help simple, fostering a culture of generosity among trusted connections.</p>
