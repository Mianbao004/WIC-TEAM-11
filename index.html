        <h1>FavorHive</h1>
        <p>FavorHive is a social network for mutual friends and the UCSD communitiy to exchange favors, such as carpooling to the airport or borrowing items. Users can post requests or offers, and members of the network can respond, thereby fostering a collaborative space of supportive networks. Our website operates similarly to a large group chat but with structured posts to track favors easily. We aim to cultivate a culture of generosity and trust that normalizes asking for favors and support.</p>
