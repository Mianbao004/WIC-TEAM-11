    <h1>FavorHive</h1>
    <p>FavorHive is a social network for mutual friends and the UCSD communitiy to exchange favors, such as carpooling
        to the airport or borrowing items. Users can post requests or offers, and members of the network can respond,
        thereby fostering a collaborative space of supportive networks. Our website operates similarly to a large group
        chat but with structured posts to track favors easily. We aim to cultivate a culture of generosity and trust
        that normalizes asking for favors and support.</p>

    <!--- About --->
    <h2>The Motivation behind FavorHive</h2>
    <p> At FavorHive, we’re all about connecting UCSD students to make everyday life a little easier—whether it's
        ridesharing, borrowing items, or simply lending a hand. We understand that with busy schedules, asking for help
        can sometimes feel as awkward or overwhelming as trying to find a parking spot on campus. To aid this, our
        platform is designed to take the initial stress out of making a request while fostering a community where
        supporting is the norm. In doing so, we also aim to
        not only strengthening campus bonds but also reduce unnecessary trips and
        environmental impacts.
